## Overview of Project
This project goal was to build an HTML page using Java Script that provides an analysis of UFO sightings based on criteria like date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFOs sightings.

The webpage allows a user to search criteria like date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFOs sightings from the data shown on the page. The screenshot below shows where the user is able to input the possible filters.

## Summary
We have created a page that allows the user to filter through sightings in our data set using the HTML search bars. One drawback to our page is that you have to search for a city that is in the data. It would be better if it were a dropdown or if it would autofill if the city were included. Also the dataset has other information that could be important to the person performing the search, such as color of the lights and how many. I would recommend 1. add a search funtion for the comments section and 2. make the search bar a drop down menu for the fields.
